### Assessment

The proposed **layer separation is architecturally sound** and should be preserved even if the names change:

1. **PEMS** should be the project-domain semantic model. It may understand chats, roles, decisions, modules, investigations, validation state, provenance, ownership, and continuity semantics.
2. A separate **domain-agnostic compact encoding** should transform normalized structured data into a smaller reversible representation without knowing what a chat, module, decision, or validation record means.
3. The canonical compact artifact should remain **syntactically valid JSON** in v1, not merely “JSON-compatible.” Keeping the representation actual JSON preserves ubiquitous parsers, Git diffs, inspection, schema validation, tooling portability, and graceful debugging. A later binary transport can be added as a separate layer if measurements justify it.
4. Expanded PEMS and compact encoding should be different contracts with independent version markers. A PEMS semantic revision should not automatically require an encoding revision, and an encoding improvement should not redefine project meaning.

### Naming analysis

**PEMS (`Project Engineering Memory Schema`) is a good working name.** It accurately communicates domain and purpose, and its domain specificity is desirable because this layer is intentionally not generic.

**JOLT is a poor public/specification name despite being memorable.** Current technology already uses “Jolt” prominently for a Java JSON-to-JSON transformation library, including Apache NiFi integration. In addition, a July 2026 research paper introduced **JOLT** as “Joint Optimization for Greedy Longest-match Tokenization,” explicitly in the compression/tokenization space. That second collision is especially damaging because the proposed expansion “JSON Optimized Linked Tokens” would put our JOLT in nearly the same conceptual neighborhood: tokenization and compression.

Recommendation: **retain JOLT only as an internal codename if the project owner strongly prefers it, but do not freeze it as the external encoding/specification name for v1 without accepting namespace ambiguity.** Rename before publishing or formalizing the contract.

### Is “Linked Tokens” accurate?

Not reliably. The planned representation includes dictionaries, enums, stable references, positional records, and normalized values. Some fields may behave like tokens, and references may be linked, but neither property is universal. “Tokens” also suggests lexical/subword tokenization, which is not the core abstraction. The term risks steering implementations toward text-token thinking instead of structured-data canonicalization.

A more accurate generic descriptor is **semantic compact encoding**, **normalized object encoding**, or **dictionary-referenced JSON encoding**.

### Recommended layering

```text
Project information
        ↓
PEMS expanded semantic model
        ↓
normalization / canonicalization
        ↓
compact JSON encoding
        ↓
project-chat-handoff.json

project-chat-handoff.json
        ↓
compact JSON decoder
        ↓
normalized PEMS
        ↓
expanded PEMS
        ↓
JSON / Markdown / search / documentation exports
```

The explicit normalization/canonicalization step is important. It prevents the encoding from quietly becoming responsible for semantic cleanup.

### Versioning recommendation

Use independent major/minor identifiers, conceptually:

- `pems_version`
- `encoding` or `codec` identifier
- `encoding_version`

For example, a compact artifact could identify `pems: 1.x` and `codec: <name>/1.x`. The decoder must reject unknown **major** encoding versions rather than guessing. Minor-version compatibility should be defined by the contract, not assumed.

Namespace identifiers should be stable strings rather than relying solely on acronyms. This leaves room for future codecs without rewriting the semantic model.

### v1 contract recommendations

Before recommending the compact representation as canonical, require all of the following:

- deterministic expanded-PEMS normalization
- deterministic compact encoding for the same normalized input
- lossless compact → normalized PEMS decoding
- semantic round-trip equality tests
- unknown-major-version failure tests
- migration tests across supported versions
- size-regression tests against representative handoff fixtures
- malformed-reference and dictionary-index validation
- deterministic human-readable export from decoded PEMS

Compression success should be measured against realistic project handoff fixtures, not a toy document. Positional records should only replace keyed objects where repeated keys materially contribute to measured size.

### Human reasoning

The strongest part of the proposal is the separation, not the acronym. Keeping PEMS distinct from the codec means project knowledge can evolve without coupling meaning to storage tricks. For example, adding a new PEMS concept such as `evidence_strength` should not require inventing a new compression architecture; the codec should simply encode another normalized field/value according to its generic rules.

Likewise, keeping the compact artifact as real JSON means a failed decoder does not turn the project memory into an opaque blob. A human or recovery tool can still inspect top-level version fields, dictionaries, and records with ordinary JSON tooling.

The JOLT collision matters because names become protocol handles. Two unrelated JSON technologies named Jolt already create search/documentation ambiguity, and the 2026 tokenization JOLT makes “Linked Tokens” especially confusing. A memorable codename is not worth baking ambiguity into a versioned interoperability contract.

### Request / next design step

Preserve the proposed PEMS/domain-agnostic-codec boundary. Treat **PEMS** as provisionally acceptable. Treat **JOLT** as a codename pending a replacement-name decision. Next, define the normalized PEMS v1 shape and a codec-neutral canonicalization contract before selecting compact field layouts.
